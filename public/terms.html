            to your account (“Fees”) according to the prices and
            terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise
            agreed between us in writing. We have the right to
            correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have
            already issued an invoice or received payment. You will
            provide complete and accurate billing information

            charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic

            charge is posted. You authorize us to obtain updated or
            replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your

            at the time of the sale. If you are required by law to
            withhold any Taxes from your payments to us, you must
